**Evening (60-90 minutes):**
- Hands-on coding practice
- Work on your weekly project
- Review and refactor previous day's code

## **Key Success Strategies**

1. **Build while learning**: Don't just read‚Äîcode every concept
2. **Progressive complexity**: Start simple, add features incrementally
3. **Code review**: Join Python communities for feedback
4. **Real projects**: Apply concepts to solve actual problems you face
5. **Tool mastery**: Set up professional development environment early

## **Recommended Learning Resources**

- **Interactive**: Python.org tutorial, Real Python website
- **Books**: "Fluent Python" for advanced concepts
- **Practice**: Build a portfolio project that incorporates multiple modules
- **Community**: Join Python Discord/Reddit for help and code reviews

Start with Phase 1 this week, and focus on building one substantial project that you can continuously enhance as you learn new concepts. This hands-on approach will make the advanced topics much more concrete and memorable.
